# MSAL/Express/Typescript/HBS/Docker/etc.

This is a sample site that I've put together with various Node.js and other services that mainly focuse on use of logging in using a Microsoft Azure tenant.

This site was built upon the sample Node.JS web App that Microsoft provides while registering an app in the Azure Portal. In addition to this I've adjusted the layouts of the routes, controllers, and brought in other ideas from past experience that includes the following topics:

- [Node.js]
- [Handlebars.js]
- [Node Express]
- [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) with Node]
- [Handlebars.js Helpers]
- [HBS Helpers with moment]
- [Bootstrap]
- [Jest]
- [Jest using Typescript (jest-ts)]

These are the basic building services I've used to generate a web site producing a a Docker Image using Typescript as base programming.
