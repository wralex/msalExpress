# MSAL/Express/Typescript/HBS/Docker/etc.

This is a sample site that I've put together with various Node.js and other services that mainly focuse on use of loggining in using a Microsoft Azure tenant.

This site was built upon the sample Node.JS web App that Microsoft provides while registering an app in the Azure Portal. In addition to this I've adjusted the layouts of the routes, controllers, and brought in other ideas from experience and more that includes the following topics:

- [Node.js]
- [Handlebars.js]
- [Node Express]
- [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) with Node]
- [Handlebars.js Helpers]
- [HBS Helpers with moment]
- [Bootstrap]
- [Jest]
- [Jest using Typescript (jest-ts)]

These are the basic building services I've used along with other items that I've picked up along to help build a web site that includes creating a Docker Image that would build using Typescript and then produce a Production layer based on the build layer.
